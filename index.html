---

This is your public research journal—a place to document experiments, capture field notes, and share your scientific
journey.

## About This Theme

The Lab Journal theme is designed for researchers who work in public. It combines:

- **Tufte-style sidenotes** for margin notes and references
- **Mathematical notation** support via KaTeX
- **Accessibility-first design** (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- **Collections** for experiments and field notes
- **Responsive design** that adapts from mobile to desktop

## Getting Started

1. Create experiments in the `_experiments` directory
2. Capture quick observations in `_field_notes`
3. Use tags to organize your research
4. Reference your work with sidenotes and cross-links

### The Proxy Problem

For years, the industry has used algorithmic puzzles—popularized by platforms like LeetCode—as a "proxy" for engineering competence. The theory was straightforward: the ability to solve a complex puzzle under pressure correlated with the ability to build complex software systems.

With the rise of Generative AI, this proxy has fundamentally broken. If a machine can solve a syntax-heavy puzzle in seconds, the puzzle no longer measures a human's capacity for engineering—it measures a process that is now largely automated. 

We are not seeing a decline in human talent; we are seeing the obsolescence of our measurement tools.

### Engineering as Systemic Reasoning

Engineering is not merely the act of writing syntax; it is the act of managing complexity and trade-offs. When AI handles the mechanical implementation (the "how"), the human value shifts to the architectural and contextual (the "why").

* **Syntax is now a commodity:** Knowing specific library calls is less of a moat when LLMs can provide them instantly.
* **Systems thinking is the requirement:** The core skill is now understanding how a specific change impacts the larger machine and predicting long-term maintenance costs.

### A Competency-Based Framework

In my work, *Reimagining Software Engineering Interviews in the AI Era*, I propose moving away from algorithmic puzzles toward real-world competency. We need to stop testing for "machine-like" speed and start testing for the things a machine cannot do: **systemic reasoning and contextual judgment**.

1. **AI-Collaborative Debugging:** Instead of banning tools, we should observe how candidates use them. Can they verify AI output? Can they spot subtle hallucinations?
2. **Focus on Trade-offs:** The interview should be a conversation about architectural choices. Why this database? What are the latency implications for downstream services?
3. **The Human-in-the-Loop Skillset:** We must evaluate the ability to orchestrate AI tools rather than asking candidates to compete with them.

### The Path Forward

If we continue to interview based on 2015 standards, we will miss out on engineers who excel at building resilient, human-centric systems but refuse to spend their time memorizing puzzles that machines now solve better. 

We aren't lowering the bar; we are moving it to where it actually matters.

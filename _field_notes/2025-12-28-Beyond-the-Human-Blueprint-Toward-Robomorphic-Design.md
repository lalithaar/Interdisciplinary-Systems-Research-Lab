### The Skeuomorphic Trap in Robotics

When the internet was in its infancy, UI design went through a phase called **skeuomorphism**, where digital buttons were made to look like physical plastic and trash cans looked like real metal bins. We did this because we didn't know how else to interface with a new medium—we tried to replicate what we knew from the physical world. 

Robotics is currently in its "skeuomorphic phase." We are obsessed with **human-mirroring**—designing machines with two arms, two legs, and a head simply because that is our biological blueprint. While this has merit in environments built specifically for humans, it shouldn't be the *only* way to design robots.

### What is Robomorphic Design?

By **robotic embodiment**, I’m referring to giving intelligence a physical "body." However, a "body" in the academic sense is simply the toolset that allows a "brain" to perform tasks.

I am proposing a shift toward **Robomorphic Design**: 
* **Native Functionality:** Designing a robot's shape based on the physics of its task rather than the aesthetics of a living organism.
* **Beyond Biology:** If a robot needs to move in all directions, it doesn't need legs that move forward; it needs omnidirectional wheels or multi-axis joints that no biological creature possesses.

### The Current Research Draft

I have published a base draft of my thoughts on this topic:  
**[Beyond the Human Blueprint: Toward Robomorphic Design in Autonomous Systems](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.32588.07049)**

{% include sidenote.html id="1" content="This paper is currently a Work in Progress (WIP). I am sharing it in its early state to invite open peer review and collaborative refinement." %}

While much of modern robotics is aimed at mirroring human tasks—see the Olympic-style capabilities of modern humanoids—we must ask: *Is the human form the most efficient way to solve this problem, or is it just the most familiar one?*

### Invitation for Revision

As this is a living research log, I am actively looking for thoughts on:
1. **The Efficiency Gap:** Where does human-mirroring actively hinder robotic performance?
2. **Standardization:** How do we classify these non-biological designs in a way that the industry can standardize?

If you have thoughts or want to build on the ideas in the preprint, please reach out.

### Beyond the Transactional User

In modern Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), we often talk about "users." But a "user" is a transactional construct—someone to be optimized, converted, or kept "engaged" via eye-catching copy and high-contrast CTAs. 

I am proposing a shift toward **Comfort Mode**: an approach to the web built for the **human** behind the screen, stripped of transactional motives. 

### Defining 'Care' as an Engineering Requirement

We do not use "Care" as a soft metaphor. We use it in a strict, ethical sense: as design that is attentive to **lived context, individual dignity, and relational needs**, rather than mere compliance with abstract norms.

* **Compliance** asks: "Does this button meet the minimum contrast ratio?"
* **Care** asks: "Does the cognitive load of this interface respect the human's mental energy in this specific context?"

This isn't about being "nice"; it is about recognizing that a human interface is a relationship, not just a tool.

### The Evolution of the Framework

My thinking on "Comfort Mode" has evolved through rigorous feedback and self-correction. 

#### 1. The Foundation: Accessibility as Care
In my paper, **[Making Accessibility Accessible, Part I: A Care Framework for Developer-Centered Tooling Infrastructure](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.19130.25285)**, I established that "Care" must also extend to the developer. If the tools we give developers are frustrating and burdensome, the "Care" for the end-user will inevitably fail. Accessibility must be built into the infrastructure, not bolted on as a chore.

#### 2. The Course Correction: Rejecting Harmful Automation
Earlier iterations of this work—detailed in **[Beyond Compliance: A User-Autonomy Framework for Inclusive and Customizable Web Accessibility](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.10324)**—explored overlay-based adaptations. 

{% include sidenote.html id="1" content="Overlays are automated scripts that attempt to 'fix' accessibility issues on the fly. Community feedback correctly identified these as harmful, as they often interfere with assistive technologies like screen readers." %}

While the philosophical foundations were correct (autonomy and personalization), the implementation was flawed. I have since explicitly rejected "unsafe" automation. The current work grounds itself in **empirical evidence**: care-centered design is not just "better" ethically; it has a measurable positive impact on tool adoption and system stability.

### Comfort as a Functional Objective

"Comfort" is the measurable result of a Care-centered system. When we apply psychophysical laws to UI spacing (as seen in my other [experiments](https://lalithaar.github.io/Interdisciplinary-Systems-Research-Lab/experiments/Perceptual-Scaling-vs-Linear-Systems-in-UI/)), we aren't just making it look "better." We are reducing the biological friction of digital interaction.

**The Goal:** A web that feels native to human perception, respects human autonomy, and acknowledges that the person on the other side of the screen has a life, a context, and a dignity that exists outside of their "use" of our software.

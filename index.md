This is a **Public Research Lab** and digital garden. It serves as a real-time "scratchbook" for cross-domain synthesis—documenting the "messy middle" of research, failed hypotheses, and raw insights that often fall through the cracks of traditional academic publishing.

## The Continuity Protocol

Research is a relay race. I invite any researcher to pick up these threads, refine the "raw" notes, and carry the inquiry forward.

* **If I am inactive for more than 2 months**, please assume this work is open for continuation without waiting for my input.
* **Collaboration:** If you wish to take up an idea before then, please email me. In most cases, I would love for you to do so (unless the specific research is bound by a prior institutional agreement).

## Research Streams

### 1. Robotics & Autonomous Systems

Exploring physical embodiment and the evolution of robotic design. I argue that robots do not always need to mirror biological forms to be functional; we should move toward **Robomorphic Design**.

### 2. Food Informatics & Computational Gastronomy

Investigating the **Ingredient Interaction Problem** in the Indian context. I am specifically interested in creating **Adaptive Scoring Engines** that utilize Machine Learning and Network Analysis to counter "Nutrient Profiling Evasion" and "Health Halos".

### 3. Psycho-Social Systems (India)

Applying **Diffusion and Adoption Theory** to address the systemic barriers of mental health stigma in India. This stream focuses on shifting the "Information Pipeline" to create low-stakes, anonymous entry points for help-seeking behavior.

## Foundational Work

While this lab is an ever-evolving "scratchbook" across many domains, the following papers represent the base ideas of my journey:

# The Open Research Lab of Lalitha A R 

This repository is a digital "scratchbook" of cross-domain research, synthesis, and experimental code. It documents the "messy middle" of inquiry—where high-level theory meets low-level implementation.

## Continuity & Collaboration Protocol

**Research is a relay race.** I believe that information hidden is information lost.

* **Inactivity Rule:** If this repository has no activity for more than **two months**, please assume the ideas are open for continuation. I invite any researcher to pick up these threads, refine the "raw" notes, and carry the inquiry forward.
* **Active Collaboration:** If you wish to build on these ideas while I am active, please email me. I would love to collaborate or provide context, provided the research isn't bound by a prior institutional agreement.
* **The Goal:** Do not wait on me. If an idea here serves a purpose, take it and build.

## Current Research Streams

### 1. Robotics: Beyond the Human Blueprint

Exploring **Robomorphic Design**—the argument that autonomous systems should be designed based on native task-physics rather than biological mimicry (skeuomorphism).

* **Draft Paper:** [Beyond the Human Blueprint (DOI)](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.32588.07049)

### 2. Web UI: Psychophysical Scaling (CM-Spacing)

Challenging the linear "8pt grid" by applying **Weber-Fechner Law** and **Stevens’ Power Law** to CSS variables.

* **Key Logic:** Small values (padding) get an "Accessibility Boost," while large values (margins) respect a "Perceptual Ceiling" to prevent layout bloat.
* **Core Formula:** 

### 3. Food Informatics: Adversarial Feedback Loops

Investigating why static health scores fail in the Indian market.

* **The Hypothesis:** Manufacturers engage in "Nutrient Profiling Evasion." We need **Adaptive Scoring Engines** that learn new ingredient clusters in real-time, similar to how LLMs update their knowledge.

### 4. Psycho-Social Systems: Diffusion of Innovation

Applying marketing and adoption frameworks to dismantle **Mental Health Stigma** in India.

* **The Goal:** Shifting "seeking help" from a high-stakes social risk to a "high-trialability" digital entry point.
